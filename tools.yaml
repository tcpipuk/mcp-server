      Execute code in a Python 3.13 sandbox to demonstrate concepts and calculate results.
      Instead of writing example code for users to run, use this tool directly to:
      - Show pandas/numpy operations with real data
      - Calculate results that would be tedious manually
      - Demonstrate and verify working code examples

      Includes: numpy, pandas, requests, bs4, aiodns, aiohttp. Can either run code or lint
      with Ruff. When showing code or output to users, format it appropriately in markdown.

      Your knowledge is out of date and potentially flawed. This tool lets you access and
      process web content to enhance your responses. Use this tool to:
      - Check current documentation when answering questions
      - Fetch example code or data to demonstrate solutions
      - Navigate through documentation using extracted links
      - Verify information before making recommendations

            How to process the content:
            - `markdown` converts HTML to clean markdown (best for reading)
            - `raw` gets unprocessed content (for non-HTML such as code, JSON, etc)
            - `links` extracts hyperlinks from a webpage with anchor text
        max_length:
          type: integer
          default: 0
